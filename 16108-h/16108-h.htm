<h2>
    MYSTERY OF CARMEL
</h2>
<pre>
The Mission floor was with weeds o'ergrown,
And crumbling and shaky its walls of stone;
Its roof of tiles, in tiers and tiers,
Had stood the storms of a hundred years.
An olden, weird, medieval style
Clung to the mouldering, gloomy pile,
And the rhythmic voice of the breaking waves
Sang a lonesome dirge in its land of graves.
As I walked in the Mission old and gray&mdash;
    The Mission Carmel at Monterey.
</pre>
<pre>
An ancient owl went fluttering by,
Scared from his haunt. His mournful cry
Wakened the echoes, till roof and wall
Caught and re-echoed the dismal call
Again and again, till it seemed to me
Some Jesuit soul, in mockery&mdash;
Stripped of rosary, gown, and cowl&mdash;
Haunted the place, in this dreary owl.
Surely I shivered with fright that day,
Alone in the Mission, old and gray&mdash;
    The Mission Carmel at Monterey.
</pre>
<pre>
Near the chapel vault was a dungeon grim,
And they say that many a chanted hymn
Has rung a knell on the moldy air
For luckless errant prisoned there,
As kneeling monk and pious nun
Sang orison at set of sun.
A single window, dark and small,
Showed opening in the heavy wall,
Nor other entrance seemed attained
That erst had human footstep gained.
I paused before the uncanny place
And peered me into its darksome space.
Had it of secret aught to tell,
That locked up darkness kept it well.
I turned, and lo! by my side there stood
A being of strangest naturehood.
Startled, I glanced him o'er and o'er,
Wondering I noted him not before.
His form was stooped with the weight of years,
And on his cheek was a trace of tears;
Over all his face a shade of pain
That deepened and vanished, and came again.
Fixed he his woeful eyes on me&mdash;
Through my very soul they seemed to see.
And lightly he laid his hand on mine&mdash;
His hand was cold as the vestal shrine.
"'Tis haunted," he said, "haunted, and he
Who dares at night-noon go with me
To this cursed place, by phantoms trod,
Must fear not devil, man, nor God."
"Tell me the story," I cried, "tell me!"
And frightened was I at my bravery.
A curious smile his thin lips curved,
That well had my bravery unnerved.
And this is the story he told that day
To me in the Mission old and gray&mdash;
    The Mission Carmel at Monterey.
</pre>
<pre>
"Each midnight, since have seventy years
Begun their cycle around the spheres,
Two faces have looked from that window there.
One is a woman's, young and fair,
With tender eyes and floating hair.
Love, and regret, and dumb despair,
Are told in each tint of the fair sweet face.
The other is crowned with a courtly grace,
Gazing, with all a lover's pride,
On the beautiful woman by his side.
Anon! a change flits o'er his mien,
And baffled rage in his glance is seen.
Paler they grow as the hours go by,
With the pallor that comes with the summons to die.
Slowly fading, and shrinking away,
Clutched in the grasp of a gaunt decay,
Till the herald of morn on the sky is thrown;
Then a shriek, a curse, and a dying moan,
Comes from that death-black window there.
A mocking laugh rings out on the air,
From that darkful place, in the nascent dawn,
And the faces that looked from the window are gone.
Seventy years, when the Spanish flag
Floated above yon beetling crag,
And this dearthful mission place was rife
With the panoply of busy life;
Hard by, where yon canyon, deep and wide,
Sweeps it adown the mountain side,
A cavalier dwelt with his beautiful bride.
Oft to the priestal shrive went she;
As often, stealthily, followed he.
The padre Sanson absolved and blessed
The penitent, and the sin-distressed,
Nor ever before won devotee
So wondrous a reverence as he.
A-night, when the winds played wild and high,
And the ocean rocked it to the sky,
An earthquake trembled the shore along,
Hushing on lip of praise its song,
And jarred to its center this Mission strong.
When the morning broke with a summer sun,
The earth was at rest, the storm was done.
Still the Mission tower'd in its stately pride;
Still the cottage smiled by the canyon-side;
But never the priest was there to bless,
And the cottage roof was tenantless.
Vainly they sought for the padre, dead,
For the cottage dwellers; amazed, they said
'Twas a miracle; but since that day
There's a ghost in the Mission old and gray&mdash;
    The Mission Carmel of Monterey
</pre>
<pre>
"A sequel there is to that tale," said he,
"Of the way and the truth I hold the key."
"Show me the way," I cried, "Show me
To the depth of this curious mystery!"
He waved me to follow; my heart stood still
Under the ban of a mightier will
Than mine. A terror of icy chill
O'er-shivered my being from hand to brain,
Freezing the blood in each pulsing vein,
As I followed  this most mysterious guide
Through the solid floor at the chancel side,
Into a passage whose stifling breath
Reeked with the pestilence of death.
Down through a subterranean vault,
Over broken steps with never a halt,
Till we stood in the midst of a spacious room,
A charnel-house in its shroud of gloom.
Only a window, narrow and small,
Left in the build of the heavy wall,
Through which the flickering sunbeams died,
Showed passway to the world outside.
Slowly my eyes to the darkness grew,
And I saw in the gloom, or rather knew,
That my feet had touched two skeleton forms,
One closely clasped in the other's arms.
Recoiling, I shuddered and turned my face
From the fleshless mockery of embrace.
Again o'er a heap of rubbish and rust,
I stumbled and caught in the moth and dust
What hardly a sense of my soul believes&mdash;
A mold-stained package of parchment leaves!
A hideous bat flapped into my face!
O'ercome with horror, I fled the place,
And stood again with my curious guide
On the solid floor, at the chancel's side.
But, lo! in a moment the age-bowed seer
Was a darkly frowning cavalier,
Gazing no longer in woeful trance,
Vengeance blazed in his every glance.
Then a mocking laugh rang the Mission o'er,
And I stood alone by the chapel door;
And, save for the mold-stained parchment leaves,
I had thought it the vision that night-mare weaves.
Hardly a sense of my soul believes,
Yet I held in my hand the parchment leaves.
Careful I noted them, one by one,
Each was a letter in rhyming run,
Written over and over, in tenderest strain,
By fingers that never will write again.
I strung them together, a tale to tell,
And named it "The Mystery of Carmel."
And these are the letters I found that day,
In the mission ruin, old and gray&mdash;
    The Mission Carmel of Monterey:
</pre>
<center>
TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON
</center>
<pre>
Oh, holy father, list thee to my prayer!
  I may not kneel to thee as others kneel,
And tell my heart-aches with the suppliant's air,
  But fiercer burns the fire I must conceal.
</pre>
<pre>
My soul is groping in the mists of doubt,
  The sunlight and the shadows all are gone,
Only a cold, gray cloud my life's about,
  Nor ever vision of a fairer dawn.
</pre>
<pre>
A father ne'er my brow in loving smoothed,
  Nor taught my baby tongue to lisp his name;
No mother's voice my childish sorrows soothed,
  Nor sought my wild, imperious will to tame.
</pre>
<pre>
Yet ran my life, like some bright bubbling spring,
  Too full of thoughtless happiness to care
If that the future might more gladness bring,
  Or might its skies be clouded or be fair.
</pre>
<pre>
Afar upon the purple hills of Spain&mdash;
  Since waned the moons of half a year ago&mdash;
I sported, reckless as the laughing main,
  Nor dreamed in life a thought of grief to know.
</pre>
<pre>
To-day I pine here in a chain whose gall
  Is bitterer than drop of wormwood brought
From that salt sea where nothing lives, and all
  The recompense my willfulness has brought.
</pre>
<pre>
Oh, holy father, list thee to my prayer!
  And though I may not kneel as others kneel,
And tell my heart-aches with a suppliant air,
  I crave they grace a sickened soul to heal.
</pre>
<pre>
Here, close beside this sacred font of gold,
  My humble prayer, oh, father, I will lay,
With all its weight of misery untold;
  And wait impatient that which thou wilt say
                                        REVENITA.
</pre>
<center>
TO REVENITA
</center>
<pre>
When to the font, this morn, my lips I pressed,
  A fairy's gift my fingers trembled o'er;
A sweeter prayer ne'er smile of angel blessed,
  Nor gemmed a tiar that the priesthood wore.
</pre>
<pre>
The secret of they grief I may not know,
  Since that thy lips refuse the tale to tell;
Methinks, dear child, it was the sound of woe
  That woke an echo in my heart's deep well.
</pre>
<pre>
The wail of a spirit that a-yearning gropes
  In darkness for the sunlight that is fled;
A broken idol in secret wept, and hopes&mdash;
  Crushed hopes&mdash;that are to thee as are the dead.
</pre>
<pre>
A tender memory ling'ring yet of when
  Each bounding pulse beat faster with its joy;
A something that allured, and won, and then
  With waking fled, and years may not destroy
</pre>
<pre>
The impress which it left upon thy brain
  But seek thee, child, grief's ravaging to stay?
Thy tears might fall as falls the show'ring rain,
  They could not wash the heart's deep scars away.
</pre>
<pre>
Repine thee not; shroud not they faith in gloom;
  Shrink not to meet a disappointment's frown;
Away beyond the narrow bordered tomb,
  Who here have borne the cross may wear the crown.
                                          SANSON.
</pre>
<center>
TO SANSON
</center>
<pre>
Whisper to him, fairies, whisper&mdash;
  Whisper softly in his ear
That some one is waiting, waiting,
  Listening his step to hear.
</pre>
<pre>
Fairies, if he knew his presence
  Would a demon's spell allay,
Would he heed your timid whisperings?
  Would he&mdash;will he come to-day?
                                        REVENITA.
</pre>
<center>
TO REVENITA
</center>
<pre>
Fairies whisper, every whisper,
  In the silence of the night,
And he catches the soft murmurs
  Floating in the starry light.
</pre>
<pre>
And they tell him; yes, they tell him,
  All in accents sweet and clear,
Of the beautiful Hereafter
  That is ever drawing near.
</pre>
<pre>
There are loved ones, waiting, waiting,
  For his footfall on the shore;
They will welcome his appearing&mdash;
  They will greet him o'er and o'er.
                                          SANSON.
</pre>
<center>
TO SANSON
</center>
<pre>
Oh, would the fairies to her whisper
  The truths which they to him impart,
Teach her a beautiful hereafter,
  A Heaven to bless a tired heart.
</pre>
<pre>
Yet thinks she that the dear ones waiting
  Would envy not the boon she craves&mdash;
To rear fair friendship's sacred alter
  Where love and hope sleep in their graves.
</pre>
<pre>
She knows not that a loving welcome
  Will wait her in a realm of light,
Nought of a future meeting whispers,
  No faith illumes her soul's dark night.
</pre>
<pre>
But oh! she knows, has by experience,
  The saddest of all lessons learned;
Knows that she gathered dead-sea apples,
  Which in her hands to ashes turned.
</pre>
<pre>
She knows into a trammelled torrent,
  Is changed her life's free flowing tide;
Knows that her hand no oar is holding,
  With which her drifting bark to guide.
</pre>
<pre>
She knows, yes, knows that, like the mirage,
  Which for the thirsty traveler gleamed,
The sweet ideal she fondly cherished
  Was never there; it only seemed.
</pre>
<pre>
If what she knows is to her proven
  A false, deluding, fleeting show,
Can she, generous spirit, can she
  Trust blindly what she does not know?
</pre>
<pre>
But if for this he shuts against her
  The heart that's shining in his eyes,
She'll bring the gift that for the Peri
  Unbarred the gate of paradise.
                                        REVENITA.
</pre>
<center>
TO REVENITA
</center>
<pre>
If she'll left him be her teacher
  In the mysteries of life,
In the spirit's grand unfoldment
  Far beyond this world of strife,
</pre>
<pre>
A sacred altar he will build her,
  And dedicate to friendship true,
And this shall be their bond of union,
  More constant that all others knew.
                                          SANSON.
</pre>
<center>
TO SANSON
</center>
<pre>
Kind teacher, henceforth be it mine,
To kneel at friendship's sacred shrine,
And hope's bright budding flowers entwine
    Into a garland for they brow.
And thou shalt wait not for the hours
That gem creation's radiant towers,
To woo thee to elysian bowers,
    But wear it now.
</pre>
<pre>
Too long a dreamer have I been,
Too long life's dark side only seen;
And if thou canst, while thus I kneel,
The mystery of life reveal,
    Then gladly will I learn of thee.
For as on flowers the dewdrops fall,
As sunbeams break the storm-cloud's pall,
As pardon comes to lives which blame
Has crushed beneath its weight, so came
    Thy sympathy to me.
                                        REVENITA.
</pre>
<center>
TO REVENITA
</center>
<pre>
    Life is love, and only love,
    Love that had its source above.
It wreathes with flowers the chastening rod,
And diamond decks the throne of God.
                                          SANSON.
</pre>
<center>
TO SANSON
</center>
<pre>
If "life is love, and only love,"
  Then never have I lived before;
But for love's sack I'll sit me down
  And careful con the lesson o'er.
</pre>
<pre>
I fain would win the shining goal,
  So far away, so seeming fair,
But could not reach its hights alone;
  Then, teacher, take me, take me there.
                                        REVENITA.
</pre>
<center>
TO REVENITA
</center>
<pre>
Thy teacher, then, will take thee there,
  And ever watch with tender care,
To guard they way to loftiest aim,
  And his reward thy love shall claim.
                                          SANSON.
</pre>
<center>
TO SANSON
</center>
<pre>
O, inconsistent teacher,
  He'd knowledge give away;
Fill head and heart, from tome of art,
  Then take me for his pay.
</pre>
<pre>
He'd kindly lead me to the realm
  Where joyous freedom reigns,
He'd teach my soul love's sweet control,
  Then claim it for his pains.
                                        REVENITA.
</pre>
<center>
TO REVENITA
</center>
<pre>
Ah! Reyenita, do not charge
  To selfishness thy teacher's plea,
He seeks thine every wish to bless,
  His deepest fault is loving thee.
"Heaven's kingdom," said the Nazerene,
"Is in the heart;" sweet fairy queen
Thou rulest along this realm of mine,
Canst say I have no place in thine?

They boast of Ormuz's milk-white pearls,
  The ruby's magic art,
And proudly wear the crystal drop
  That fires the diamond's heart.
</pre>
<pre>
And these may admiration claim,
  And countless wealth may sway,
But rarer gem was given to me,
  One golden summer day.
</pre>
<pre>
Its wondrous tints, a brilliant glow,
  Emit in darkest gloom,
A sweeter fragrance 'round it clings,
  Than breath of eastern bloom.
</pre>
<pre>
Were all earth's costly jewels thrown
  In one great glittering heap,
They could not buy for ev'n a day
  The gem I'd selfish keep.

Yet 'twas not won from pearly depths,
  Nor gleaned from diamond mine,
Nor all the chemist's subtlety
  Its substance could define.

<pre>
It ne'er was set in band of fold
  Some dainty hand to grace,
Ne'er shone in diadem to deck
  A brow of kingly race.

  Lies prisoned in its beams,
Hours of enchanted ecstacy
  And days of Eden dreams.

Wouldst know the precious gift with which
  For worlds I would not part?
The priceless jewel is they love,
  Its setting is my heart.

O, in the hush of midnight's hour,
  How oft from taunting dreams I start,
To find thee but a fancy flower&mdash;

I've a beautiful home, where I live in my dreams,
So joyous and happy&mdash;an Eden it seems;
All beautiful things in nature and are
Are blending to rapture the mind and the heart;
No discords to jar, no dissensions arise,
'Tis calm as Italia's ever blue skies,
When kissed by the bright rosy blush of the morn;
And a voice of the spheres on the breezes is borne,
Soft as the murmur of sea-tinted shells,
Sweet as the chiming of far away bells;
And grief cannot enter, nor trouble nor care,
And the proud peerless prince of my soul, he is there.
</p>
<pre>
In my beautiful home from the cold world apart,
He holds me so close to his fast beating heart;
More enchanting his voice than the syren-wrapt song,
O'er the wind-dimpled ocean soft floating along,
As he whispers his love in love's low passioned tone,
Such home, and such lover, no other has known.

O, let us leave this world behind&mdash;
Its gains, its loss, its praise, its blame&mdash;
Not seeking fame, nor fearing shame,
Some far secluded land we'll find,
And build thy dream-home, you and I,
And let this foolish world go by.
</p>

A paradise of love and bliss!
Delicious draughts in Eden bowers,
Of peace, and rest, and quiet hours,
We'll drink, for what we've missed in this.
The shafts of malice we'll defy,
And let this foolish world go by.

From puzzling doubts I've sought to wake;
Must joy, or misery, hence be mine,

A desolated land to me;

Away from your arms; I would be,
The life drops that flow in your veins,
The pulses that throb in your heart.
My bosom should be the warm sea
Of forgetfulness, tinged with the stains
Of the sunset, when day-dreams depart;
You should drink at its fountain of kisses,
Drink mad of its fathomless deep;

Submerged in an ocean of blisses,
I'd be something to kiss and to keep.
Loving, and tender, and true,

Yet stand, to-day, a sacrilegious tower,

I'll crush the agonies that burning swell,
        And say farewell.

Thou'st crowned me with they love and bade me wear it,

</pre>
<p>
And thou pale tape light, by whose fast-dying flame I write these
words&mdash;the last my hand shall pen&mdash;farewell! What is't to die? To be
shut in a dungeon's walls and starved to death? She knows, and soon will
I. She sought to learn of me, and I to teach to her, the mystery of
life. Ha, ha! Who claimed her by the church's law has given us both to
learn the mystery of death. What was't I loved? The eyes that thrilled
me through and through with their magnetic subtlety? They're there, set
on my face; but where's their lifened light? What was't I loved? The
mouth whose coral redness I have buried in my own? 'Tis there, shrunk
'gainst two rows of dead pale pearls, and cold and colorless as lip of
statue carved of marble. Was it the form whose perfect outline stamped
it with divinity? It's there, but 'reft of all its winsome roundness,
and stiffening in the chill of death. It makes me cold to look upon its
rigidness. But just this hour the breath went out; was't that I loved?
'Twas this I clasped and kissed. What is it that we've christened love,
that glamours men to madness, and stains with falsehood virgin purity?
It made this grewsome charnel vault a part of Heaven&mdash;the graves there
of those murdered knaves made rests of roses for our heads; it made him
spring the bolt and lock us in. Where is the creed's foundation? I've
shrived a thousand souls&mdash;I cannot now absolve my own. To quench this
awful thirst, I cut an artery in my arm and sucked its blood. The
thirstness did not cease. They lied. 'Twas not the vultures at
Prometeus' heart, 'twas hunger at his vitals gnawed. The salt drops that
I swallowed from that vein have set my brain on fire. What's that? The
ground's a-tremble 'neath my feet as touched with life. Earth, rend your
breast and let me in! For anything but this dire darkness, made alive
with vengeful eye-balls&mdash;his eyes! They glare with hate at me. I heard
him laugh but now. For anything but this most loving corpse whose head
caressing rests it on my feet. Ah, no, I did not mean it thus; I would
not get away alone. I loved that corpse. It was the sweetest bit of
human frailty that to man e'er brought a blessing or a curse. I turned
from Dias' holy grail to taste its nectar. Hell, throw a-wide your
sulphur-blazoned gates, I'll grasp it in my arms and make the plunge!
Hist! what was that? I heard him laugh again. Laugh, fiend, you cannot
hurt me more. Ah! Reyenita, mine in life you were, in death you shall be
mine. When this clogged blood has stopped the wheels of life, I'll put
my arms around your neck, I'll lay my face against your frozen one, and
thus I'll die. When this foul place has crumbled to the sunlight, some
relic-hunting lunatic will stumble o'er our bones, and pitiless will
weave a tale for eyes more pitiless to read. Back, Stygian ghoul!
Death's on me now. I feel his rattle in my throat! My limbs are blocks
of ice! My heart has tuned it with the muffled dead-march drum! A jar of
crashing worlds is in my ears! A drowsy faintness creeps upon&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

    The seal is broken, the mystery tell;
    You have read the letters, what do they tell?
    Do they tell you the story they told that day
    To me, in the Mission old and gray&mdash;
        The Mission Carmel at Monterey?

</h2>
<pre>
I hear her rocking the baby&mdash;
  Her room is just next to mine&mdash;
And I fancy I feel the dimpled arms
  That round her neck entwine,
As she rocks, and rocks the baby,
  In the room just next to mine.
I hear her rocking the baby
  Each day when the twilight comes,
And I know there's a world of blessing and love
  In the "baby bye" she hums.
I can see the restless fingers
  Playing with "mamma's rings,"
And the sweet little smiling, pouting mouth,
  That to hers in kissing clings,
As she rocks and sings to the baby,
  And dreams as she rocks and sings.
</pre>
<pre>
I hear her rocking the baby,
  Slower and slower now,
And I know she is leaving her good-night kiss
  On its eyes, and cheek, and brow
From her rocking, rocking, rocking,
  I wonder would she start,
Could she know, through the wall between us,
  She is rocking on a heart.
While my empty arms are aching
  For a form they may not press
And my emptier heart is breaking
  In its desolate loneliness
I list to the rocking, rocking,
  In the room just next to mine,
And breathe a prayer in silence,
  At a mother's broken shrine,
For the woman who rocks her baby
  In the room just next to mine.

<h2>
    "I DON'T CARE."

<pre>
"I don't care," we hear it oft
  And oft, the words are seeming fair;
But many a heartache lies beneath
  A careless "I don't care!"
</pre>
<pre>
In every age, from every tongue,
  The vain assertions fell;
But oh, trust not the cheating words,
  For never truth they tell!
Hearts may grow sick with hope deferred,
  Be crushed with black despair,
But lips, too proud to own defeat,
  Will whisper, "I don't care!"
</pre>
<pre>
A thoughtless friend flings out in jest&mdash;
  As jesters always do&mdash;
A deadly shaft you wince beneath,
  You know the story's true;
But while the dart has pierced your heart,
  And poisoned, rankles there,
You look amused, and answer with
  A smiling, "I don't care!"
</pre>
<pre>
When Fortune's favors are withdrawn,
  And friends like shadows fled,
When all your fondest dreams are gone,
  Your dearest hopes are dead,
You curse the fickle goddess, then,
  Who wrought you such despair,
Yet hide chagrin beneath a frown,
  And mutter, "I don't care!"
</pre>
<pre>
The veteran, battle-scarred, who fills
  A nation's honored place,
Feels keener than his saber's point,
  Unmerited disgrace.
With indignation all aflame
  He meets some rival's stare;
But for all answer gives the worlds
  A freezing "I don't care!"
</pre>
<pre>
A woman's heart is trifled with,
  Her hopes are ground to dust,
Her proud soul humbled with neglect,
  Betrayed her sacred trust,
Yet, while to desperation stung,
  With death and ruin there,
She'll crush the tears and cheat you with
  A laughing "I don't care?"
</pre>
<pre>
"I don't care!" 'tis but a breath,

<h2>
    A STAINED LILY.
</h2>
<pre>
Some lilies grew by a brook-side,
  Tall and white, and cold,
And lifted up to the sunshine
  Their great red hearts of gold.
</pre>
<pre>
And near to their bed grew mosses,
  rank vines, and flowers small,
And loathsome weeds, and thistles,
  And the sunlight warmed them all.
</pre>
<pre>
Anon, the proud white lilies
  Were gathered one by one,
Each to crown a festal
  Rarest under the sun.
</pre>
<pre>
One lily stooped to the brooklet,
  Her face she knew was fair,
And the face of flowing water
  Mirrored her image there.
</pre>
<pre>
A hand upraised in envy,
  Or carelessness, or jest,
Flung from the turbid water,
  Mud, on the lily's breast.
</pre>
<pre>
And all the proud, white lilies
  Turned their faces away,
And nobody plucked that lily,
  And day, and night, and day
</pre>
<pre>
She wept for her ruined beauty:
  And the dew-drops, and the rain,
Touched with her tears, in pity
  Fell on the muddy stain.
</pre>
<pre>
Still stood she in her grieving
  Day, and night, and day;
Nor tears, nor dew, nor rain-drops,
  Could fade the stain away.
</pre>
<pre>
Pining in desolation,
  Shunned by each of her kind,
Sought she a bitter solace
  In creatures of a coarser mind.
</pre>
<pre>
But the breath of the nettle stung her,
  And the thistle's rude embrace
Burned her sensitive nature,
  And scarred the fair, stained face.
</pre>
<pre>
Lower drooped the lily,
  And died at the feet of the weeds;
And only the tender mosses
  Ministered to her needs.
</pre>
<pre>
And still the tall while lilies
  Stand as cold, and proud,
And still the weeds and thistles
  Against the lilies crowd.
</pre>
<pre>
Alike the same warm sunbeams,
  On weed and flower fall,
Alike by the same soil nourished,
  And the great God made them all.

  With which this love has bound thee,
Nor dream thee of the hand that flung

  Will love thee on forever.

<h2>
    WHICH ONE
</h2>
<pre>
Each was as fair as the other,
  And both as my life were dear;
And the voices that lisped me mother,
  Heaven's music in my ear.
</pre>
<pre>
One faded from life&mdash;and mother,
  And died in the summer dawn;
And I turned away from the other
  And wept for the child that was gone.
</pre>
<pre>
Then I lay in a weird sleep-vision,
  Before me an earth dark scene,
And the land of the sweet Elysian,
  And only a grave between.
</pre>
<pre>
One child soft called me mother
  Out from the shining door,
And smile and beckoned; the other
  Unconsciously played on the floor.
</pre>
<pre>
One's path, to my inward seeing,
  Was light with a wondrous day,
And led to the heights of being,
  And an angel showed the way.
</pre>
<pre>
The other lay where Marah's
  Hot sands with snares are strewn&mdash;
Through many a darksome forest,
  And the way was roughly hewn.
</pre>
<pre>
A faith to my soul was given&mdash;
  The weird sleep-vision o'er&mdash;
And I turned from the child in heaven
  To the child that played on the floor.

<h2>
    LIFE'S WAY
</h2>
<pre>
Good-bye, sweetheart, he said, and clasped her hand,
  And rained his kisses on her tear-wet face;
Then broke away, and in a foreign land.
  For her dear sake, sought gold, that he might place
</pre>
<pre>
Love's jeweled crown upon his queen's fair brow,
  And pour his hard-won treasures at her feet;
And swore, than Heaven, than life itself, his vow
  To her he held more sacred and more sweet.
</pre>
<pre>
She waited as the woman only may
  Whose eyes are blinded oft with unshed tears;
Lines on her forehead grew, and threads of gray;
  The weary days crept into weary years.
</pre>
<pre>
"Oh stars, go down! Oh sun, be shrouded now!
  My love comes not; he does not live," she said;
And brushed the curls he'd kissed back from her brow,
  And pout on mourning for her dead.
</pre>
<pre>
And still as oft the day came round that he
  Had left his warm good-bye upon her lips,
As oft she sought the head-land by sea,
  And longing watched the far-off white-sailed ships.
</pre>
<pre>
To-day, the low sand-beach was over-strewn;
  Torn sail, and broken spar and human form,
'Gulfed by the waves, and crushed, and then out-thrown&mdash;
  A ship went down in yester-night's wild storm.
</pre>
<pre>
She walked among the debris, and the dead,
  As some sweet mercy-sister on her round,
Scanning each up-turned face with nameless dread,
  For aught of life; her tireless searching found
</pre>
<pre>
A babe&mdash;a waif with tawny tangled locks,
  And great blue eyes with wonder brimming o'er;
Of all the human freight wrecked on the rocks,
  The only living thing that washed ashore.
</pre>
<pre>
A pearl-gemmed golden case upon its breast
  She oped, then stared, her eyes a-sudden wild,
A name, a pictured face told all the rest;
  His name&mdash;his face&mdash;his child!

<h2>
    UNCLE SAM'S SOLILOQUY.
</h2>
<pre>
I'm a century old and more to-day&mdash;
  A ripe old age for a modern man,&mdash;
Yet they who rocked my cradle, they say,
  Predicted a thousand years my span;
They christened me at the fount of prayer,
And gave me a star-gemmed robe to wear.
</pre>
<pre>
My first free breath was battle-smoke
  A prayerful nurses did not abhor
The sounds that first my ear awoke&mdash;
  The clash and din and shout of war.
They pressed in my hand a crown of might
And pointed my way to the eagle's flight.
</pre>
<pre>
Cannon and sword were my playthings to bless,
  (Dangerous toys for a babe to try,)
The stirring reveille my more caress,
  The wild tattoo was my lullaby;
And well, methinks, as they years have run,
Have I wrought the work my sires begun.
</pre>
<pre>
An infant prodigy I, and ere
  Expired a tenth of my granted day,
I wrested from lion-grasp the spear&mdash;
  A nation's power I held in sway;
I broke the gives from freedom's graves,
And steam and lightning I bound my slaves.
</pre>
<pre>
I flung my starred robe on the breeze,
  From burning tropic to arctic cold.
On distant isles, in distant seas,
  A foot-hold gained with sword and gold.
Atlantic's slope and Pacific's strand
I bound together with an iron band.
</pre>
<pre>
But of late I've premature grown old;
  There's something wrong with the clothes I wear;
There is something wrong with the helm I hold,
  Else I hold it wrong,&mdash;there's wrong somewhere.
Disease too has thrown me his poisoned dart;
His workman are "striking" right at my heart.
</pre>
<pre>
My head is so strangely vision thrilled
  With plans to evade the demon's stay,
But all the plots that my brain have filled
  Only have served to augment his sway,
And on my feet, at the sunset's door,
Is spreading a troublesome grievous sore.
</pre>
<pre>
I'm growing ill I can plainly see,
  And many prescribe my pain to ease,
But somehow each medicine proves to be
  "A remedy worse than the disease."
Though strong as ever, should once my strength
Give way, I must fall a fearful length.
</pre>
<pre>
My doctors say they know the cause,
  And they've gone to work with eager zest,
Probed and expounded with weighty straws,
  And leeches attached to my troubled breast;
I fee them well, as attests my purse
But day after day I'm growing worse.
</pre>
<pre>
Though they have not yet touched the cause they knew,
  And are wrangling over its direful flood,
They promise to build me better than new,
  And stop the drain on my famished blood;
But lest they're careful while building the dam
They'll scoop out a grave for "Uncle Sam."

Upraised to mine in sad surprise;
I held two tiny hands in mine,
  I kissed the little maid farewell.
Her cheeks to deeper crimson flushed,
  The sweet, shy glances downward fell;
From rosy lips came&mdash;ah! so low&mdash;
    "I love you, do not go!"
</pre>
<pre>
I see it through the lapse of years&mdash;
This picture, ofttimes blurred with tears.
No tiny hands in mine are held,
  No sweet brown eyes my pulses wake&mdash;
Only in memory a voice
  E'er bids me stay for love's sweet sake.

Laugh, little bright-eyes, hang up your stocking;

Through the key-hole slyly peeping,
Down the chimney careful creeping,
When the little folks are sleeping,
Comes he with his pack of presents.
Such a grin! but then so pleasant
You would never think to fear him;
And you can not, must not hear him.
He's so particular, you know,
He'd just pick up his traps and go
If but one little eye should peep
That he thought was fast asleep.
Searching broomstick, nails, and shelf,
Till he finds the little stocking&mdash;
Softly lest you hear his knocking&mdash;
Smiling, chuckling to himself,
He fills it from his Christmas store,
And out he slips to hunt for more.
</p>
<pre>
Then laugh, little bright-eyes, and hang up your stocking;
      Don't count the days any more;

<h2>
    OPENING THE GATE FOR PAPA.
</h2>
<pre>
Hurrying out to the gateway
  Go two little pattering feet;
Eagerly out through the palings
  Peer two eyes bright and sweet.
</pre>
<pre>
A footstep as eager is answering
  The sweet eyes that patiently wait
And papa is kissing, and blessing
  The baby that opens the gate.
</pre>
<pre>
And every day all the long Summer,
  At noontime and evening late,
The little one's watching for papa&mdash;
  Waiting to open the gate.
</pre>
<pre>
And now the bright Summer is ended,
  And Autumn's gay mantle unrolled;
The maple leaves wooing the breezes
  Are gorgeous in crimson and gold.
</pre>
<pre>
At noonday the face at the gateway
  Is flushed with a feverish glow,
At night the bright head on the pillow
  Is tossing in pain to and fro.
</pre>
<pre>
The father kneels down in his anguish,
  And stifles the sobs with groan;
He knows that his idol is going&mdash;
  Going out in the midnight alone.
</pre>
<pre>
He buries his face in the pillow,
  Close, close, to the fast failing breath;
A little arm clasps his neck closely,
  A voice growing husky in death
</pre>
<pre>
Says pleadingly, half in a whisper:
  "Please, darling papa, don't cry;
I know Birdie's going to Heaven&mdash;
  I heard doctor say he will die;
</pre>
<pre>
"But I'll ask God for one of the windows
  The pretty star-eyes look out through,
And when you come up with the angels
  I'll sure be the first to see you.
</pre>
<pre>
"And maybe I'll find my dear mamma;
  And you'll come up, too, by-and-by,
And Birdie will watch for you, papa,
  And open the gate of the sky."
</pre>
<pre>
The little hand falls from his shoulder
  All nerveless, the blue eyes dilate,
A shuddering sigh, then the baby
  Is waiting to open the gate.

As sweet thy breath as Eden's balm,

Once pledged we fondly o'er and o'er
That nought should cloud our love's bright sky;
Once thought we that we could not stay
Apart and live. But oh! For us
Fate willed it not to linger thus.
To-day earth's wintry poles apart
Are further not that we in heart,
Nor colder than our sunless way.
Passion and pride can do no more,
And you and I can only say
        Good-bye! Good-bye!

        Good-bye! Good-bye!
So sad it seems the sound of tears,
So sad it seems life's parting sigh,
And yet, alas! It can but be.
Deserted ghostly wrecks of
Once freighted with Hope's golden gleams,
Wrecks drifting on a sullen sea,
To mock the memory-haunted years,
Are all now left to you and me.

<h2>
    IN THE TWILIGHT.
</h2>
<pre>
In the twilight gray and shadowy,
  Deepening o'er the sunset's glow,
Softly through the mystic dimness
  Flitting shadows come and go.
</pre>
<pre>
As my thoughts in listless wandering
  With these phantom shadows fly,
Meseems they wear the forms of faces,
  Faces loved in days gone by.
</pre>
<pre>
One by one I recognize them
  As they silent gather near;
Some are loving, childish faces,
  Knowing naught of grief or care.
</pre>
<pre>
Some are blooming, youthful faces,
  Victory confident to win,
Some are from the contest shrinking,
  Wearied with the strife and din.
</pre>
<pre>
Some are aged, wrinkled faces,
  Time life's sands has nearly run;
Not a leaflet spared of Springtime,
  Not a furrow left undone.
</pre>
<pre>
Other faces, sweet, sad faces,
  Wafted o'er the Lethean sea,
Radiant smile in twilight shadows,
  But they came not back to me.
</pre>
<pre>
In the twilight, dreamy twilight,
  When the sultry day is gone,
Quietly o'er vale and hillside,
  Tenderly as blush of dawn,
</pre>
<pre>
Come the timid evening breezes,
  Sighing through the Summer leaves,
Transient as thought's pencil-paintings,
  Sweet as weft that fancy weaves.
</pre>
<pre>
And as shadows in the twilight
  Shapeful forms of faces wear,
So these dainty, light-winged zephyrs,
  To my hearing, voices are.
</pre>
<pre>
Voices whose sad intonations
  Seemingly, as flit they past,
Bring to memory hopes long shattered,
  Blissful dreams too bright to last.
</pre>
<pre>
Voices, merry laughing voices,
  Fondly loved in other years,
Mournfully are whispering to me
  That their mirth was drowned in tears.
</pre>
<pre>
Telling of a fairer fortune
  Far away 'neath tropic skies,
Telling of a broken circle,
  Scattered friends and severed ties.
</pre>
<pre>
Other kindly, loving voices,
  Winning in the long ago,
Tell me now, as then they told me,
  "Thou canst live for weal or woe."
</pre>
<pre>
Are these weird and mystic voices
  But creations of the brain?
Only in illusive fancy
  Must I hear their tones again?
</pre>
<pre>
Would some magic power lend me
  Aid to stay the witching tone,
Art to pain the beauteous picture
  Ere its impress swift has flown.
</pre>
<hr>
<pre>
While I dreamed the day has faded,
  Stars are shining overhead,
Evening winds have ceased to whisper,
  Twilight's shadows all have fled.
</pre>
<pre>
Thus, too oft, our life-work seemeth,
  And we, when disowned its sway,
Find we are pursuing phantoms,
  Shadows in the twilight gray.

<h2>
    HOME.
</h2>
<p>
"How many times and oft" has the sweet, sweet word been sung in song and
told in story. And he sang sweetest of home, who had never a home on
earth. If one to whom home was only a poet's dream, could portray its
charms by only imagination, until a million hearts thrilled with
responsive echo, how deeper, how more intense must be his longings and
recollections who treasures, deep down in his heart the sweet delights
and pure associations that he has known, but never may know again. We do
not appreciate our blessings until they have passed. We do not try to
gather the sunbeams until the clouds have obscured them.
</p>
<p>
How many and many a youth, brave-hearted and true, answers with eager
haste the war call of his native land all heedless of the home he is
leaving, and the loving arms that sheltered him there. But when his
soldier's blood is crimsoning the sands beneath a foreign sky, the
thoughts that go with his ebbing life are of home&mdash;all of home.
</p>
<p>
Who rushes from his home out into the world, blind devotee of fortune's
phantom goddess, to realize a phantom indeed, sits down in his
despondency and his despair, to dream of "dear old home".
</p>
<p>
Yes, too, and the wretch&mdash;so seemingly depraved that nothing beautiful
or pure of soul is left&mdash;who flings from him his life  in mad suicide,
goes out into that trackless eternity with home upon the lips of death.
Then if the patter of baby's feet, the glad ring of children's voices
echo within the walls of your home, if father and mother; and brothers
and sisters brighten it with the sunshine of love, enjoy it while you
may, make it your heaven, and be not in over-haste to break the ties
that bind you there.
</p>
<p>
You may never weep, perchance, over a home made desolate by death; and
yet, time&mdash;so surely as time is&mdash;will make it but only a memory. And all
too late each heart will learn that it did not prize enough the
blessedness of home.

<h2>
    WHY?
</h2>
<pre>
Why is it we grasp at the shadow
  That flits from us swift as thought,
While the real that maketh the shadow
  Stands in our way unsought?
And why do we wonder, and wonder,
  What's beyond the hill-tops of thought?
</pre>
<pre>
Why is it the things that we sigh for
  Are the things that we never can reach?
Why, only the sternest experience
  A lesson of patience can teach?
And why hold we so careless and lightly
  The treasures that are in our reach?
</pre>
<pre>
Why is it we wait for the future,
  Or dwell on the scenes of the past,
Rather than live in the present
  Hastening from us so fast?
Why is it the prizes we toil for,
  So tempting in fancy's mould cast,
Prove, when to our lips we have pressed them,
  Only dead-sea apples at last?
And why are the crowns, and the crosses,
  So wondrous inequally classed?
</pre>
<pre>
Ask it, ye, over and over,
  Let the winds waft your question on high,
Till memory wanes with the ages,
  Till the stars in eternity die.
And out from the bloom and the sunshine,
  From the rainbow o'erarching the sky,
From the night and the gloom and the tempest,
  Echo will answer you, "Why?"

<h2>
    OUT IN THE COLD.
</h2>
<h3>
    Suggested by reading, "Lights and Shades" in San Francisco.
</h3>
<pre>
Out from a narrow, crowded street,
Sick'ning resort of shame and crime,
  Wearing upon her brow a curse,
Out in the darkness, lost to sight,
Out in the dreary Winter night,
  Fleeing a fate than Nessus worse.
On through the gathering mist and dew
'Till the fog-wrapped city is hid from view;
  'Till the rugged cliffs with the waters meet,
And the mingled voices from every clime
  And the hurrying tramp of reckless feet
Are drowned in the breakers' sobbing rhyme.
But farther out than this ocean beach,
Farther than Charity's hands will reach,
Farther than Pity dares to come,
Is she who rushes, with white lips dumb,
To repeat the tale that too oft is told&mdash;
          Out in the cold.
</pre>
<pre>
From the loathesome dens whose scenes appal,
Whose tainted breath's the Simoom's blast;
  Away on the dizzying, surf-washed rock,
Pausing a moment upon the brink&mdash;
Pausing a moment perchance to think;
  Sliding the bolt in Memory's lock,
And back in its dusty, haunted hall,
Living again the vanished past&mdash;
Living her happy childhood o'er;
  Chasing the butterflies over the flowers,
Petted and loved, a girl again,
  Dreaming away the golden hours;
Living again another scene,
Flattered and toasted "beauty's queen;"
Taking again, with a merry laugh,
From gallant hands a sparkling draught.
O, angels, tell her 'tis a draught of woe!
That ruin lies in its amber glow.
Over the rest let oblivion fall,
Cover it up with a funeral pall;
Turn away with a shudder and groan,
Let her live it over alone.
Few are the months, as they count, since then;
Short and joyous they else had been
That to anguished heart and maddened brain
Are long decades of woe and pain.
Over, again, on the wings of thought,
Treading the path which her ruin wrought;
Over again each step she went,
From the sunny home to the swift descent,
Where sin lies hidden 'neath a gilded pile,
Down to the haunts of the low and vile.
One more step and it all is done.
  Only a shriek the midnight breaks&mdash;
Only a splash in the waves below,
  A wider ripple the water makes.
The rock is bare by the ocean side&mdash;
A death-white face with the ebbing tide
Is floating away from the headland bold&mdash;
          Out in the cold.
</pre>
<pre>
A lifeless form, in the wintry dawn,
  Left on the sand by a rising swell;
A story of weakness, shame, and wrong
  Mutely the frozen features tell.
Noiseless falls on it, the tears of dew,
  Over it softly the breezes blow;
Wavelets, kissing the tangled hair,
  Murmur a requiem sad and low.
Out to the barren, bleak hillside
  Rough hands bear it with scorn and jest.
Cradled once in a mother's arms&mdash;
  Once by a mother's fond lips pressed&mdash;
Under the clods of a new-made grave;
  A rough-hewn board at the foot and head,
Where never a flower of love shall wave;
  Left with the city's nameless dead&mdash;
Left with her fate unwept, untold&mdash;
          Out in the cold.

<h2>
    A NEGLECTED "WOMAN'S RIGHT."
</h2>
<p>
I have listened to this cry of "Woman's Rights," this clamoring for the
ballot, for redress for woman's wrongs, and I could but think, amid it
all, that there is one "woman's right"&mdash;the right that could make the
widest redress for woman's wrongs&mdash;which she holds in her own hands and
does not exercise. It is the right to defend, to uplift and ennoble
womankind; to be as lenient to a plea for mercy from a fallen woman as
though that plea had come from the lips of a fallen man; to throw around
her also the broad mantle of charity, and if she would try to reform,
give her a chance. Far be it from any honest woman to countenance the
abandoned wretch who plies an unholy calling in defiance of all
morality, for her very breath is contamination; but why should you greet
with smiles and warmest handclasps of friendship the man who pays his
money for her blackened soul? When two human beings ruled by the same
mysterious nature, have yielded to temptations and fallen, what is this
monster of social distinction that excuses the sin of one as a folly or
indiscretion, while it makes that of the other a crime, which a lifetime
cannot retrieve? It is a strange justice that condones the fault of one
while it condemns the other even to death; that gives to one, when dead,
funeral rite and Christian burial and to the other the Morgue and a
dishonored grave, simply because one is a strong man and the other a
weak woman. And it is a stranger, sadder truth that 'tis woman's
influence which metes out this justice to woman. Mother, if you must
look with scorn and contempt upon the woman who through her love for
some man has gone down to destruction, do not smilingly acknowledge her
paramour a worthy suitor for your own unsullied daughter. Maiden, if you
must sneeringly raise your white hand and push back into the depths of
pollution the woman who seeks to reinstate herself in the path of
rectitude, do not permit the man who keeps half a dozen mistresses to
clasp his arm around your waist and whirl you away to the soft measure
of the "Beautiful Blue Danube." If the ban of society forbids that you
say to a penitent sin-sick sister, "Go and sin no more," if you must
consign her to the life of infamy which inevitably follows the deaf ear
which you turn upon her appeal, then do it; but in God's name do not
turn around and throw open the doors of your homes and welcome to the
sanctity of your family altars the man who enticed her to ruin. Ah,
woman, by your tireless efforts you may win the right to vote, your
voice may be heard in the Assembly Halls of the Nation; but if you
administer as one-sided a justice in political life as you do in social
life, the reform for which you pray will never come!

    CONSOLANCE.

"Be brave?" why, yes, I will; I'll never more despair;
  Who could, with such sweet comforting as yours?
How, like the voice that stilled the tempest air,
  Your mild philosophy its reasoning pours.

<pre>
Go you and build a temple to the skies, and make
  Your soul an alter-offering on the pile;
Then, from its lightning-riven ruin, take
  Your crushed and bleeding self, and calmly smile.
</pre>
<pre>
When loud, and fierce, and wild, a storm sweeps o'er your rest,
  Say that it soothes you&mdash;brings you peace again;
Laugh while the hot steel quivers in your breast,
  And "make believe" you love the scorching pain.
</pre>
<pre>
See every earthly thing your life is woven round,
  Fall, drop by drop, until your heart is sieved!
Go mad and writhe, and moan upon the ground,
  And curse, and die, and say that you have prayed and lived!
</pre>
<pre>
Then come to me, as now, and I will take your hand,
  And look upon your face and smile and say:
"All were not born to hold a magic wand;
  Cheer up, my friend, you must be brave always."

    WHEN THE ROSES GO.
</h2>
<pre>
You tell me you love me; you bid me believe
That never such lover could mean to deceive.
You tell me the tale which a million times
Has been told, and talked, and sung in rhymes;
You rave o'er my "eyes" and my "beautiful hair,"
And swear to be true, as they always swear;
But the wrinkles will grow, and the roses go,
And lovers are rovers oft, you know,
        When the roses go.
</pre>
<pre>
I have heard of a woman, sweet and fair,
With dewy lips and shining hair,
And you pledged to her, on your bended knee,
The self-same vow you make to me.
She was fairer than I, I know;
She was pure and true, and she loved you so;
But the wrinkles will grow and the roses go&mdash;
How she learned that trouble comes, you know,
        When the roses go.
</pre>
<pre>
You're a man in each outward sense, I trow,
With the stamp of a god on your peerless brow.
You hold my hand in your thrilling clasp,
And my heart grows weak in your subtle grasp,
Till I blush in the light of your tender eyes,
And dream of a far-of paradise&mdash;
Almost forgetting that ever from there
Another was turned in her bleak despair.
But the wrinkles will grow, and the roses go&mdash;
I will answer you, love, my love, you know,
        When the roses go.

With odds all against him, struggling to gain,
From fortune a name, with life to maintain,
Toiling in sunshine, toiling in rain,
Never waiting a blessing Heaven-sent,
Working and winning his way as he went&mdash;
Whether he starved, or sumptuously fared,
Nobody knew and nobody cared.

With success-crowned effort that fate had defied,
That wrought out from fortune what favor denied,
Standing aloof from the world in his pride;
The niche he has carved on fame's slippery wall

His Croesus-bright scepter has magical sway,
Yester's indifference solicits to-day.
His daring his triumph, how daily he fares,
Every one knows, and anxiously cares.

<h2>
    POOR LITTLE JOE.
</h2>
<pre>
A ring on the door bell,
  Some one at the door,
Mute asking admittance
  Where never before
A stranger in midnight,
  In silence and stealth,
Sought access to gain
  In a mansion of wealth.
Into the gaslight
  A package is borne;
Quickly from round it
  The wrappings are torn.
What is it? a baby!
  What seek you to-night,
So rosy and smiling,
  Nor in fear, nor in fright?
</pre>
<pre>
Ah! little intruder,
  What is it you wear
So close to your breast?
  Sure but hand in despair
Could have written the message
  Unconscious you bear,
And "loved" and "God blessed" you
  While leaving you there.
Let's see the story
  'Tis telling for you;
How brief and pathetic;
  But can it be true?
A mother heart brokenly
  Praying in grief
From hand of a stranger
  Her baby's relief.
"He's helpless and homeless,
  But stainless as snow;
O, take him and keep him&mdash;
  My poor little Joe."
</pre>
<pre>
That's all there is of it,
  If false or if true;
Yet long enough seems it,
  And sad enough, too.
No love-welcomed greeted
  The sweet baby face,
In the life that gave his life
  There was not a place.
No place for the baby,
  There's none for him here,
No heart that may give him
  A smile or a tear.
Off to the refuge,
  For such, he must go,
He's only a foundling&mdash;
  Poor little Joe.
</pre>
<pre>
Deserted, forsaken,
  Thrust out in the strife,
Adrift on the pitiless
  Ocean of life.
What will become of him,
  Who may decide
If good or if evil
  His life shall betide.
No tender caresses
  Ever to know,
Nor guidance, nor blessing&mdash;
  Poor little Joe.

Does somebody kneel 'way over the sea,

Does somebody watch and weep and pray
  For the tramp who lies dead in the lane to-day?

With such look of awe and pity?

Nor how, when silence seals the lips,

We do not know from whence the life
  Imbued in crystal drop of rain,
Nor why, when torn and trampled on,
  The rose's fragrance will remain.
Nor know we why the tender tone
  Will linger when love's dream is fled,
Now why the smile we loved will live,
  Although the face it wreathed will be dead.
</pre>

Some strangely fascinating spell
  Steals o'er the heart in ethic's hour;
We know not what, nor how, nor why,
  Still must we own we feel its power&mdash;
A power that wakens slumbering dreams,
  Intangible emotion swells,
That penetrates the soul's deep fount,
  And greets the tide that from it wells.

It is not charm of form or face,
  Nor is it long contact of years
That wins this mutual soul response,

A glance may into being start
  Vain hopes that nevermore may sleep.

The quiet touch when hands are clasped
  Would seemingly no sense impart,
Yet may it wake a deathless theme
  And send it quivering to the heart.
And thus may kindred spirits feel,

The sweet impassioned eloquence,
  The magic of unspoken words.

<h2>
    THE WITHERED ROSEBUD.
</h2>
<pre>
I gathered you, sweet little rosebud,
  With a dew crown encircling your head;
Now, out of the window I toss you,
  Shriveled, and scentless, and dead.
You had opened to wondrous perfection,
  Had only my hand let you pass;
Yet here you have perished for water&mdash;
  I forgot to put some in the glass.
</pre>
<pre>
Ah! poor little withered, dead rosebud,
  How many a weak human heart,
Too like you, has famishing perished,
  When life had but only a start?
Yes, many a heart, little rosebud,
  Loving, and tender, and true,
For water has faded and withered,
  And died in its beauty like you,
Not because there was dearth of life's fountain,
  Nor the blessing to all might not pass,
But because the strong hand which it clung to
  Forgot to put some in its glass.

<h2>
    MY SHIPS HAVE COME FROM SEA.
</h2>
<pre>
You are watching a ship, O, maiden fair,
With parted lips and wistful air,
The ship that out from the sheltered bay
With white sails spread moves slow away;
And I know, my girl, the thoughts that burn
In your heart are of ship's return.
Ah! I know so well how your pulses beat,
With the great sea sobbing at your feet;
And the yellow stars in southern skies
Are brighter not than your love-bright eyes.
I, too, have stood on the sea-wet sand
And tearful waved a farewell hand,
And watched with many a longing prayer.
My face, like yours, was young and fair,
And my eyes were bright as the diamond's glow;
They've lost their sparkle&mdash;long ago.
I stand along on the beach to-day,
Watching the ships that sail away;
But never a sail from over the sea
The flowing tide will bring to me,
      My ships have come from sea.
</pre>
<pre>
The first was builded with childish hand,
It floated away a castle grand&mdash;
A beautiful bubble with rainbow hues,
Lined with the crystal of morning dews;
To break at my feet by the sunny sea,
A beautiful bubble came back to me&mdash;
      Came back from my ship at sea.
</pre>
<pre>
I fashioned another in gladsome way
And sent it forth on a Summer day.
      I see it yet, a fairer craft,
Never at danger mocking laughed;
Its shrouds were the sheen of happy hours,
Its helm a wreath of orange flowrs;
And I freighted it down with love and truth,
The golden hopes of my sunny youth.
Had it lived the storm&mdash;but it could not be,
A stranded wreck on the surf-washed lea,
      My ship came home from sea.
</pre>
<pre>
And then a smiling fairy bark,
A fragile, precious-freighted ark,
Out on life's ocean drear and dark.
And I prayed to God as I never before,
To shield this back from the tempest's roar,
To spare me this&mdash;but it could not be,
A tiny coffin came back to me&mdash;
      Came back from my ship at sea.
</pre>
<pre>
With reckless hand I launched again,
A venture on the treacherous main,
Bound for ambition's dizzy court;
Sailed from a hopeless, loveless port;
With gloomy walls whose silence chilled,
With ghostly haunting memories filled,
With never a breath of the roses dead;
Never a rest for a weary head,
Never a dream of a sweet to be,
Hopeless, loveless still, to me,
      My ship came home from sea.
</pre>
<pre>
The last, and least, of all the ships
Fashioned with hands, and heart, and lips,
I pushed from shore with its decks untrod
And the freight it bore was my faith in God.
I recked not whither its way, nor when,
Nor how, if ever, 'twould come again,
And this, alone, came back to me,
Rich-laden from the stormy sea.
And so, sweet maiden, while your dreams
Paint fairest all that fairest seems,
I stand with you and watch to-day
The ship that sails form the shore away;
But never a sail from over the sea
The flowing tide will bring to me&mdash;
      My ships have come from sea.
      My ships have come from sea.
</pre>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
